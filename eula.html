        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Privacy Statement</b></font></font></p>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica">
<p>We want you 
  to know that we take your privacy seriously. We request personally 
  identifiable information only when you place an order, register a 
  product, request a service, correspond with us, or engage in certain 
  other activities on our website. We do not sell, rent, or lease your 
  personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your 
  permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal 
  data you provide us with third parties who perform a particular 
  service on our behalf, such as companies that verify credit card 
  information, process credit card payments, or fulfill orders. Please 
  read this Privacy Policy carefully. It is short and you don't need 
  to be a lawyer to make sense of it. </p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Information Collected and How It Is Used</font></b></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">We request personally identifiable information only when you 
place an order, register a product, request a service, correspond 
with us, or engage in certain other activities on our website. For 
example: If you choose a service or transaction that requires 
payment, we will request personal information necessary for billing, 
such as: name, address, telephone number, and credit card number. Or 
if you request technical support online, we will ask you for 
information --</font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
such as your name, e-mail address, and information about your 
computer hardware, software, and the nature of the problem you are 
experiencing. You make the decision whether to proceed with any 
activity that requests personally identifiable information. </font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">We collect two types of information: (1) "Personally Identifiable 
Information" (such as name and e-mail address) and (2) "Anonymous 
Statistical Information" (such as how many users visited our web 
site last month). "Personally Identifiable Information" is 
non-anonymous information such as your name, phone number, credit 
card information, address or e-mail address --</font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
anything that could identify you personally. For example, we may ask 
you for personally identifiable information when you download our 
software, register for a trial license, or purchase a permanent 
license.</font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">
<p>In order to tailor our communications to you and continuously 
improve our products and services, we may also ask you for 
information regarding your personal or professional interests, 
demographics, experience with our products, and more detailed 
contact preferences. You will have the option of choosing not to 
provide us with this information. </p>
<p>We use your e-mail address to send registration reminders and to 
notify you of new software releases, updates, special offers, and 
news. For your convenience, each announcement contains instructions 
on how to be removed from all future mailings. You may also e-mail 
support@bonzi.com at any time to ask to have your e-mail address 
removed from future mailings. </p>
<p>Separately, we send service notifications via e-mail to keep you 
informed about the status of your service and to provide updates and 
technical notices. These messages are essential to the maintenance 
of your subscription and the functionality of our services. 
Therefore there is no opt-out option available for these service 
notifications. </p>
<p>We use "Anonymous Statistical Information" to better design our 
website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an 
advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on 
our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled 
out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that 
could be used to identify those individuals. </p>
<p>We maintain log files of the traffic that visits our website. We 
do not link the information gathered in these log files to 
personally identifiable information. Log files are used to manage 
traffic loads and information technology requirements for providing 
reliable service. Information collected includes IP addresses, 
browser types, operating systems, domain names, access times, and 
referring Web site addresses. </p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Cookies</font></b></p>
<p>We use cookies to understand traffic patterns and to improve the 
content and offerings on our site. Cookies, by themselves, do not 
tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable 
information. </p>
<p>The information we collect with cookies is not sold, rented, or 
shared with any outside parties. We only use cookies to remember 
user preferences, maximize performance of our services, and deliver 
more relevant content to you. </p>
<p>We do not require that you accept cookies. Most browsers can be 
set to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance 
to decide whether or not to accept it. </p>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our 
site. These companies may employ cookies and pixel tags (also known 
as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising 
effectiveness. We do not require that you accept cookies from these 
companies in order to access our services. If you would like more 
information about advertising companies serving ads on our site, 
their business practices, and their privacy policies, go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050405053512/http://www.bonzi.com/bonziportal/index.asp?l=thirdpartypolicies">
http://www.bonzi.com/bonziportal/index.asp?l=thirdpartypolicies</a>
</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Pixel Tags</b></font></p>
<p>We use pixel tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web 
beacons) to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor 
behavior, and response to promotional campaigns, as a supplement to 
our server logs and other methods of traffic and response 
measurement. We may also implement pixel tags provided by other 
companies for the same purpose. </p>
<p>Pixel tags are not used to access personally identifiable 
information; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated 
statistical data about site usage. With most browsers, you can 
disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images; 
or there are commercial software packages available that can omit 
pixel tags and most advertisements. </p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Sharing Information with Third Parties</font></b></p>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable 
information to others. Unless we have your permission or are 
required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide us 
with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, 
such as companies that verify credit card information, process 
credit card payments, or fulfill orders. </p>
<p>We may share "Anonymous Statistical Information" with third 
parties. For example, visitor and customer information may be 
statistically aggregated and reported to advertisers. However, we 
will not report any information that could be used to personally 
identify you, such as your name, e-mail address, account, password, 
or transaction history. </p>
<p>We may from time to time send promotional messages on behalf of 
other companies. If we do this, we will not provide them with your 
personal information. </p>
<p>If we should ever sell assets (or the assets of a division) to 
another entity, or if our company (or a division) is acquired by, or 
merged with, another entity, we may provide to such entity customer 
information that is related to that part of our business that was 
sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent. It is 
customary for customer information to be included with transferred 
assets in these types of transactions. </p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Links</font></b></p>
<p>Our site contains links to other sites. Please note that when you 
click on one of these links, you are 'clicking' to another Web site. 
We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked 
sites, as their privacy policies may differ from ours. </p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Children's Privacy Policy (Age 13 and 
Under)</font></b></p>
<p>We operate our site and services in compliance with the 
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and therefore we do not 
seek to collect any personally identifiable information from anyone 
under 13 years of age. </p>
<p>At various places on our sites, and within our software, we may 
offer users the option to submit their birth date and/or age. If we 
become aware that a person submitting personal information to us is 
under the age of 13, then we delete the information as soon as we 
discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it 
to third parties. </p>
<p>Since we do not seek to collect any personally identifiable 
information from anyone under 13 years of age, and we delete any 
information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a 
child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about 
children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests 
review or deletion of information about their child before we have 
discovered and deleted the information, we are happy to honor such 
requests. </p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Community and Public Areas</font></b></p>
<p>Information posted to message boards, chat areas, clubs, and home 
pages is available to the general public. Please use caution when 
posting any such information. </p>
<p>Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to 
provide any personally identifiable information while using chat 
rooms or message boards. </p>
<p>Users of chat areas and message boards must follow acceptable 
standards of behavior when posting messages online. Bonzi reserves 
the right to, but is not obligated to, refuse or delete any content 
that in our sole discretion is considered inappropriate. </p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Our Commitment to Security</font></b></p>
<p>We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and 
managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized 
access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we 
collect online. </p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Changes To Our Privacy Policy</font></b></p>
<p>We will occasionally change this Privacy Policy to keep it up to 
date with our products, services, and web pages. If there is a 
significant change, we will indicate on our web site that our 
privacy policy has changed and provide a link to the new policy. If 
at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in 
a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, 
you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your previously 
submitted information in this different manner. </p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF">No Error-Free Performance</font></b></p>
<p>We are constantly updating our software and services by fixing 
bugs, adding new features, and enhancing existing features. For this 
reason we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite 
our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy 
concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products generally, 
in all stages of release. However, Bonzi Software, Inc. does not 
guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. We will 
use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will 
take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply 
with this privacy policy. Under no circumstances, including but not 
limited to negligence, shall Bonzi Software, Inc. be liable for any 
special, incidental, or consequential damages that result from the 
use of the software, information, or services on our sites, even if 
Bonzi Software, Inc. or an authorized representative of Bonzi 
Software, Inc. has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be 
completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under 
our control to intercept or access transmissions or private 
communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect all personally 
identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security 
of any information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done 
at your own risk. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws 
of the United States.</p>
<p>We operate our site and services in compliance with The Database 
Security Breach Notification Act and if we ever discover a security 
breach in which your personal data may have been compromised, we 
promise to notify you along with all other affected customers, and 
to explain what security measures are currently in place or have 
been deployed to prevent additional compromises in the future. </p>
